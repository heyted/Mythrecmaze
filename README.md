# Mythrecmaze 

Automatically record the TV shows you follow on TVmaze.com using MythTV.

For usage instructions, please see https://dvrhtpc.blogspot.com/2018/05/mythrecmaze.html.

Mythrecmaze allows you to record the TV shows you follow on TVmaze.com using MythTV.  Instead of setting a recording using MythTV, follow your shows on tvmaze.com to have them recorded. The program checks the ical feed for the next seven days. It then downloads guide data for the current day each time it is run and the next six days only if there is a change in the ical feed for those days. It supports multiple ical tokens, so everyone in the house can have their own TVmaze login.

Notes:

Changing the MythTV xmltvid values is not required. Mythrecmaze is compatible with other guide sources if the guide entries inserted from Tvmaze matching the recordings are not overwritten by the other guide source.

This program currently works in the USA only, but this could easily be changed.

Mythrecmaze has been tested using Mythbuntu 16.04 with MythTV 28 and 29. Version 20160802 is the last release to support MythTV 27.
